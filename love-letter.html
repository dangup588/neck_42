        <h1>Hi handsome :)</h1>
        <p class="love-text">I’m sorry I’m busy today. I would’ve loved nothing more than to be with you—especially in your arms or hearing your voice. The voice I still fall in love with after almost four years. The voice I will always share my life with.</p>
        <p class="love-text">We usually don’t talk about when I was super little—probably because I was utterly obnoxious. I spent my time playing softball in my backyard by myself, pretending to beat up literally no one, throwing a ball against the wall to be the best, climbing trees, playing Club Penguin, or letting my thoughts wander into oblivion. But those were never the normal thoughts of little girls. I never thought or dreamt of marriage or children or boyfriends, because they were either foreign or tainted. Even in middle school and high school, I didn’t really like anyone more than the surface level attraction, because I didn’t need anyone to be at my side for really anything. </p>
        <p class="love-text">The first time I heard your voice, I knew I couldn’t ever let you go. Even, if at first, it was because I selfishly wanted to hear it again.</p>
        <p class="love-text">I’ve loved you since that first day and have never stopped even wanting to since then. I was so absolutely terrified to snap you, which is why I didn’t add you back for a whole day. I could just hear how attractive you are. I thought you wouldn’t like someone who wasn’t comfortable with their own femininity yet. I thought you would stop liking me for how I looked. But after seeing you-your green/blue eyes, nice clothes, the way you cared for me-I’ve become more confident in my own body. I began caring for myself just because you’re here. Because you were mine. Eventually, I no longer felt the need to care for just myself, but you too. I know I’m still learning, but I always want to make you food, bring you coffee, or help you with any task ever. You’ve shown me how to love and care, and you’ve grown with me through it. You showed me that marriage and relationships aren’t what I was always exposed to. After a while of your never ending support, stability, and confidence in me, plus your love for me, I started dreaming and thinking and wanting to care for you in our own home with our own children after our own wedding. The dream of walking down the aisle to the love of my life-his neatly kept blonde/brown hair, endless blue/green eyes, broad shoulders, and the best hugs, cuddles, kisses, tongue, and body ever-is starting to feel more real than ever. I can’t wait to share the rest of my life with you, and especially the night after that dream comes true ;)</p>
