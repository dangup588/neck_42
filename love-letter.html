        <p class="love-text">I’m sorry I’m busy today. I would’ve loved nothing more than to be with you—especially in your arms or hearing your voice. The voice I still fall in love with after almost four years. The voice I will always share my life with.</p>
        <p class="love-text">We usually don’t talk about when I was super little—probably because I was utterly obnoxious. I spent my time playing softball in my backyard by myself, pretending to beat up literally no one, throwing a ball against the wall to be the best, climbing trees, playing Club Penguin, or letting my thoughts wander into oblivion...</p>
        <p class="love-text">I’ve loved you since that first day and have never stopped even wanting to since then...</p>
